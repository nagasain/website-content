Say you have an array of objects like this, which contains a set of date objects:

```js
const activities = [
  { title: 'Hiking', date: new Date('2019-06-28') },
  { title: 'Shopping', date: new Date('2019-06-10') },
  { title: 'Trekking', date: new Date('2019-06-22') }
]
```

You want to sort those activities by the `date` property.

You can use the `sort()` method of `Array`, which takes a callback function, which takes as parameters 2 objects contained in the array (which we call `a` and `b`):

```js
const sortedActivities = activities.sort((a, b) => {
  //return new Date(b.date) - new Date(a.date) //Generic Way
  return +b.date - +a.date;
})
```

When we return a positive value, the function communicates to `sort()` that the object `b` takes precedence in sorting over the object `a`. Returning a negative value will do the opposite.
